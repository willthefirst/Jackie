						One day, the mother sent Jackie to the market to sell the family cow. But on her way, Jackie met a strange man, who showed her a handful of <span class='glow js_beans'>magic beans</span>. He explained that the beans were more valuable than any amount of money, because if planted, they would transform into a giant beanstalk. Jackie was sold. But when she returned home with no money, no cow, but three little beans, her mother was furious. She grabbed the beans out of Jackie's little hand, threw them out the window, and sent Jackie to bed, without the little dinner that there was.

						But as Jackie approached the house, she realised that it was not little at all: it was giant. It had a giant door with a giant doorknob, and was surrounded by giant trees. Jackie, so accustomed to little things, felt littler than ever.

						Jackie ventured inside, and came upon a <span class="glow js_coins">stack of gold coins</span>, <span class="glow js_harp">a golden harp</span>, and a <span class="glow js_gooseandegg">goose that laid golden eggs</span>. Jackie seized each one, hoping to show these newfound riches to her mother. But suddenly, a giant roar from a giant voice filled the giant house.

						The giant voice belonged to a giant. Jackie, mortified, bolted for the door. But the giant called out:
