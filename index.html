						One day, Jackie's mother sent her daughter to sell their the cow. But Jackie, on her way to the market, met a strange man, who held in his hand <span class='glow'>three magic beans</span>. He told Jackie that the beans were more valuable than any amount of money, because if planted, they would transform into a giant beanstalk. Jackie was mystified, and decided to trade her cow for the beans. But when she returned home with no money, no cow, and just three little beans, her mother was furious. So furious that she grabbed the little beans out of Jackie's little hand, threw them out the window, and sent poor Jackie to bed, without the little dinner that there was.

						But as Jackie approached the castle, she realised that it was not little at all: it was giant. It had a giant door with a giant doorknob, and was surrounded by giant trees. Jackie, so accustomed to little things, felt littler than ever.

						Curious Jackie ventured into the house, and saw a sack of gold coins, a golden harp that played itself, and a goose that laid golden eggs. Thinking that these giant objects could give her family all the money they would ever need, Jackie seized each one. But suddenly, at the very moment that she closed her pouch after taing them, she heard a giant roar from a giant voice.
